# AlProfiler

AlProfiler is a memory profiler that helps programmers to understand the memory consumption of Python applications by interactive visualizations.

AlProfiler runs on top of [Pharo](http://pharo.org), the live programming environment.

## System requirements
AlProfiler needs of the library [psutil](https://pypi.org/project/psutil/) of Python. To install psutil, execute the following script on the terminal:
```
pip install psutil
```

## How to use

**Run AlProfiler**: Open a terminal and execute the following script: 

```
python AlProfiler.py <pathPrincipalFile.py> <runFunction> <argumentsFunction>

```
AlProfiler need the path of the principal python file, the running function of the application and if it's necessary the arguments for the function.
For example:
```
python AlProfiler.py example.py main

```
This will generate a directory AlProfiler_example with three .csv files.


**Start AlProfiler**: Open your Pharo 7 image and evaluate the following inside Pharo:
```smalltalk
Metacello new
	baseline: 'PyMemory';
	repository: 'github://Balison/AlProfilerMemory:master';
	load.
```
Select the PyMemory menu and open the directory generated by AlProfiler by clicking on the open button and choose the directory.
